    Hi there, I&apos;m Rob Reynolds
  </h1>
  <p className="relative mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-none">
    For over a decade, I&apos;ve been in the outdoor industry—guiding, photographing, and filming adventures. My peers call me the <span className="text-pine italic">&quot;Backwoods Techie&quot;</span> because I know what it&apos;s like to hustle in the wild and still make the tech side work for my clients.
  </p>
  <p className="relative mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-none">
    <span className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-900">But here&apos;s the deal:</span> After years of filling my clients&apos; books through compelling visuals, I realized the real game-changer wasn&apos;t just the photos or videos—it was the website behind them. A high-converting site that does the heavy lifting, turning curious browsers into paying customers.
  </p>
  <p className="relative mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-none">
    <span className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-900">I started off just like you—</span> a small business owner in the outdoor world, unsure how to reach more clients and feeling the pain of missed opportunities. I learned, through trial and error, how to build websites that actually make the phone ring.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
    Now, I&apos;ve doubled down on what really moves the needle: strategic web design that converts. My photography and video skills? They&apos;re still in the toolkit—but only to supercharge your website&apos;s effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p className="relative mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-none">
    I know how overwhelming it can be trying to grow an outdoor business in a crowded digital space. That&apos;s why I&apos;m laser-focused on building websites that immediately capture attention, showcase your brand authentically, and bring in more paying clients—so you can spend less time worrying about marketing and more time doing what you love.
